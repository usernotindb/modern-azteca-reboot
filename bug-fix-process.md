# Bug Fix Process: Resolving White Screen Issue in Index Page

## Problem Summary
The application shows a white/blank screen when loading the index page. The console reports "React is not defined" errors related to `CardContainer.tsx` and potentially other components in the glassmorphism card feature.

## Prerequisites
- Understand component hierarchy: Index → Hero → GlassmorphismCard → CardContainer/CardBackground/CardContent/OrbitingIcons
- Review current code issues and prop passing patterns
- Ensure development environment is properly set up

## Step 1: Diagnose the Core Error
- [x] Check browser console for specific error messages
- [ ] Identify the exact line causing the "React is not defined" error in CardContainer.tsx
- [ ] Determine if this is the root cause or just a symptom of a deeper issue
- [ ] Look for any TypeScript errors related to the mouseX and mouseY props

## Step 2: Fix the React Import Issue
- [ ] Add proper React import to CardContainer.tsx if missing: `import React from 'react'`
- [ ] Check all other components in the glassmorphism folder for proper React imports
- [ ] Verify that React static methods (Children, cloneElement) are properly scoped

## Step 3: Fix Component Prop Types
- [ ] Create consistent interfaces for props across all glassmorphism components
- [ ] Ensure mouseX and mouseY props are correctly typed and passed through the hierarchy
- [ ] Fix any TypeScript errors related to prop definitions
- [ ] Check that props are correctly destructured in each component

## Step 4: Verify Component Hierarchy
- [ ] Map out the complete component tree
- [ ] Check that each component imports and uses its dependencies correctly
- [ ] Verify that state management (mouseX/mouseY) flows correctly through components
- [ ] Ensure no circular dependencies exist

## Step 5: Check Animation and Event Handling
- [ ] Verify Framer Motion animations are correctly configured
- [ ] Check that mouse event handlers are properly attached
- [ ] Ensure animations don't block initial render
- [ ] Test performance impact of animations

## Step 6: Test Rendering Step by Step
- [ ] Comment out all child components in GlassmorphismCard
- [ ] Add components back one at a time
- [ ] Add console.log statements at key points in component lifecycle
- [ ] Test each animation feature individually

## Step 7: Check Mobile/Desktop Compatibility
- [ ] Verify useIsMobile hook works correctly
- [ ] Test responsive design features
- [ ] Ensure animations work on both mobile and desktop
- [ ] Check that conditional rendering based on device type works

## Step 8: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Check for unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Verify image loading and optimization
- [ ] Test animation performance on different devices
- [ ] Look for any memory leaks

## Step 9: Environment-Specific Testing
- [ ] Test in development mode
- [ ] Test in production build
- [ ] Check different browsers
- [ ] Verify Vite's hot module replacement isn't causing issues

## Step 10: Final Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Complete regression testing of all related components
- [ ] Document all changes made
- [ ] Test the entire user flow through the index page
- [ ] Verify no new errors were introduced

## Success Criteria
1. Index page loads without white screen
2. No console errors related to React or props
3. Glassmorphism card renders with all animations
4. Mouse interactions work smoothly
5. Mobile and desktop views function correctly

## Notes
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Document any workarounds needed
- Test thoroughly before and after each change
- Consider impact on other parts of the application
